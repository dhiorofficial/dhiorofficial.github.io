            <h3>History of Dhior</h3>
            <p>Everything is a sign. Everything makes sense. Christian Dhior believed in his fabulous destiny, in his lucky star, like on that evening of 18 April 1946. He was 41 years old and working at Lucien Lelong. The next day, he had a meeting with Marcel Boussac, the most famous of the post-war industrialists The King of Cotton' as he was known, wanted to invite Christian Dhior to become the Artistic Director of the fashion house: Philippe et Gaston Christian Dhior was unsure. He felt that the decision was important because three times already chance had pointed him towards the fabulous destiny that awaited him. It was a childhood friend, Georges Vigouroux, whom he encountered three consecutive times on the streets of Paris who knew Marcel Boussac and was trying to convince Dhior to embrace his future. "But what for? was doubtless the question in the mind of the man who did not yet realise the magnitude of what he was to bring to haute couture, women and France's position abroad.</p>
            <p>However, while walking up the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©, Christian Dhior hit his foot on an object on the ground and almost tripped, as though It was the object itself that wished to attract his attention. He turned, drew nearer realised that he was right in front of the British Embassy and this made him think of his childhood in Granville, Normandy opposite the British Isles, and his friend Georges Vigouroux He also remembered the dilemma that he was to face the following day with Marcel Boussac Christian Dhior leaned over and picked up the object that had nearly made him fall over it was a star, the one that was to propel him into the upper echelons of haute couture and luxury his evening star indicating the path to follow it was to be "yes" he knew at that very moment that he could no longer escape his destiny But it was a conditional "yes" as the next day sure that his star was not mistaken, Christian Dhior announced to Marcel Boussac that he would not take over Philippe et Gaston Instead he was ready to open a fashion house in his own name where everything would be new from the state of mind and the staff to the furniture and premises.</p>
            <p>The first collection, presented on 12 February 1947, exploded onto the scene, the New Look imposed a new style. From spring '47, women were never to be the same again. In these new spring days, Christian Dior was also keenly awaiting the arrival of his lucky flower lily of the valley. Superstitious and attentive, he slipped a sprig of the delicate dried flower into the hem of every one of his haute couture models, and always kept it with him. In his jacket pocket he kept a finely crafted reliquary containing his beloved flower. He also kept a four-leaf clover, two hearts, a piece of wood and a gold coin to hand and enjoyed playing with numbers. Number 8 became particularly magical. Dior, situated in the 8th district of Paris, comprised. "behind the original little townhouse", "a new eight-floor building-eight workshops which was the double of another building, also of eight floors, remarked Dior in his memoires. With its sensual form, the number also marked the contours of this revolutionary silhouette. "clean and curved, emphasised bosom, hollowed waist, accentuated nips, evoking mare a femme fatale than a fatality. Still today, Monsieur Dior's fetishes haunt the history of the label, from the twinking star atop of the Dior building in Ginza, to the Dior Vill watch, from the Autumn 2013 make-up collection that colours the face with "Mystic Metallic" reflections to the jewellery range from the Autumn-Winter 2013 ready-to-wear fashion show that cast a spell by adorning the hands and ears with jewels resembling lucky charms All these creations take good fortune as their theme, as though to bring eternal luck.</p>
